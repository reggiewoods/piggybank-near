NEAR DApp which allows a user to save their NEAR.

Currently i have it configured to count to 3 then reset for testing purposees.

In theory; A user will click the button which will deposit 1 NEAR into the contract which will hold it until the user deposits 109 more times. On the 110th deposit, the contract will return the total sum of NEAR that they have deposited. Very simple yes... however i have little experience with coding so what i thought would be a one day project quickly turned into 3+ days of non-stop coding and researching. Please fix the contract.


Good luck!
